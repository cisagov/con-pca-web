                        <p>This report provides the results for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National
                            Cybersecurity
                            Assessments and Technical Services- (Vulnerability Management) led Continuous Phishing
                            Campaign
                            Assessment (CON-PCA) for {{ detail?.customer.full_name }}. The CON-PCA is a practical
                            exercise
                            intended to support and measure the effectiveness of security awareness training for
                            information
                            system users. The results of this CON-PCA show the susceptibility of
                            {{detail?.customer.identifier}}
                            personnel to social engineering attacks—specifically email phishing attacks—in which an
                            adversary tricks an email user into clicking a malicious link to gain unauthorized network
                            access. In
                            the scenario that this CON-PCA tested, the phishing attack bypassed technical controls that
                            would
                            normally detect and/or block malicious emails and links. The CON-PCA, therefore, measured
                            {{detail?.customer.full_name}}’s level of vulnerability to a successful phishing attack by
                            targeted
                            user
                            click rates, click times, response rates, and response times, as shown in Table 1.</p>

                        <p>This report aims to enhance {{ detail?.customer.full_name }}'s understanding of their
                            information
                            system users’ cybersecurity behavior and to promote a more secure and resilient workforce.

                            detect, report, or stop the email phishing attempts. VM, as an external body conducting this
                            PCA, did not have direct knowledge whether or not emails successfully arrived in targeted
                            {{ detail?.customer.full_name }} user inboxes. To allow for a clear determination of click
                            rates email links clicked
                            divided by emails sent), {{ detail?.customer.full_name }} or VM performed the following:</p>

                        <p>This PCA concentrated on how phishing email complexity affected
                            {{ detail?.customer.full_name }} user
                            click behavior and
                            response behavior. VM expects that a more complex and deceptive phishing email has a higher
                            likelihood of being clicked and a lower likelihood of being reported. This assessment also
                            gathered organizational emails through open-source intelligence techniques to determine
                            {{ detail?.customer.full_name }}’s potentially attackable online presence. See

                    <p>One of the most common measures of an organization’s susceptibility to phishing attacks is
                        targeted-user click rates. If an actual phishing attack is able to bypass technical controls and
                        arrive in a user’s inbox, the human target must agree to click on the malicious link or
                        attachment for the attack to be successful. In practical exercises such as this PCA,
                        targeted-user click rates will fluctuate depending on the email complexity used in testing.
                        Effective security awareness training, however, should result in a noticeable click rate
                        decrease over time and to a level deemed acceptable based on the organization’s risk management
                        posture.</p>
                    <p>The counterpart to user click rates is the user-reporting rate, determined by the number of
                        emails sent or calls to alert {{ detail?.customer.full_name }}’s helpdesk during each campaign.
                        Based on
                        previous
                        testing, VM recommends that organizations aim to have two people reporting the phishing attempts
                        for every person that clicks. This ratio ensures that there is not only reporting coverage for
                        the person clicking, but also redundant coverage in case the person who clicks the link does not
                        report or does not realize they have been phished. Effective security awareness training should
                        result in a noticeable report rate increase over time and to a level deemed acceptable based on
                        the organization’s risk management posture.</p>

                    <p>To contain an attack, an organization’s security team must be aware of the potential breach. In
                        the scenario that this PCA tested, no technical controls were triggered during a phishing attack
                        and the clock for a potential breach started once a targeted user clicked on a “malicious” link.
                        Timely user reporting decreases the window of opportunity that an adversary has to access data
                        or gain further network entry. Timely reporting also increases the opportunity the security team
                        has to detect and respond to a potential breach. By educating users on how to both spot and
                        promptly respond to phishing attempts, an organization can improve their anti-phishing defenses.

                            external sender, or have outlandish and ridiculous claims.</p>

                            Moderate: Moderate level templates are more sophisticated then low level and should be more
                            difficult to detect. This level of email may have well written prose, be grammatically
                            correct, and professional in display but be general in nature.</p>

                            large. They use this targeted information to provide a feeling of familiarity to better
                            deceive the target. This level is the most difficult to identify as malicious. </p>
